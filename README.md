# Viewmaker Networks: A Reproducibility Study

This repository contains a reproduction of the paper [Viewmaker Networks: Learning Views for Unsupervised Representation Learning ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07432). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

We performed our experiments on a ubuntu linux machine with tensorflow version 2.6.0, CUDA version 9.1, and CUDnn version 8.2.4

To install the necessary dependencies, run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The command
```
source init_env.sh
```
is necessary to allow absolute imports and run the script files. 

Complete environment setup:
```setup
git clone https://github.com/pfrwilson/viewmaker_reproduction
cd viewmaker_reproduction
conda create -n my_env
conda activate my_env
source init_env.sh
```


## Training

Instructions for training the model available shortly
## Evaluation
