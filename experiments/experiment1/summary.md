This experiment achieved a 0.72 training accuracy and 0.69 validation accuracy, which is lower than that reported by the authors. We hypothesize that this may be due to an inappropriately chosen temperature (0.07). Although this is the temperature used by the authors, they had a slightly different loss function than us, and we have seen a temperature more on the order of 0.5 in other implementations of simclr online.
